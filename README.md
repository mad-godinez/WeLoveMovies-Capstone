**HEADS UP!** 
<br> If you see the error message shown below, <ins>don't worry.</ins> The app is working 
  perfectly fine - the :cloud: cloud service hosting my database can only accept a few connections at a time.
  
   Just refresh your browser tab & wait a second or two and everything should load up properly. Thanks for understanding!

## About Me:
- My name is Mad, you can think of it as "Maude" or "Mod" in your head,
  whichever works!
- I'm currently enrolled in Thinkful's Fullstack Software Engineering course &
  having a really great time learning this material. I also earned my BA in
  Spanish Studies & Computer Science from Texas State University (*magna cum
  laude* woot woot!) in the winter of 2021, so I was fortunate to have a good
  foundation of programming knowledge going into this course. 
- This bootcamp is wrapping up at the beginning of May 2022, so please feel free
  to reach out if you've got me in mind for a junior developer role! 

My [ðŸŒ² LinkTreeðŸŒ² ](https://linktr.ee/madgodinez) has the best ways to find me
online, as well as my resume. 


## About the Project: WeLoveMovies
### Project Description:
<div class="description">"You've been hired on as a backend developer at a new startup called
WeLoveMovies! As another developer works on the design and frontend experience,
you have been tasked with setting up a database and building out specific routes
so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews."</div>

### Routes:
| Path   | Description (starting at the trailing `/` of the site's URL)   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ `  | Homepage :house: Shows all movies currently playing in theaters.      |
| `/movies ` | All Movies :movie_camera: Shows a list of all movies on record.   |
| `/theaters ` | All Theaters :clapper: Shows a list of all movie theaters & their addresses.   |
| `/movies/# ` | Movie Details & Reviews :newspaper: For movie number where '#' is between 1 & 16, inclusive; shows its summary, runtime, maturity rating, average review score, where it's being shown, & the reviews for the movie.   |


### The Application's Tech Stack & Tools:
<ins>Development:</ins>

  - **Production Tier / Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Bootstrap,
    Visual Studio Code
  - **Application Tier / Backend:** JavaScript, Express.js (+Express
    [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors)), Knex.js 
  - **Data Tier / Database:** PostgreSQL, DataGrip, Postman 
  
<ins>Deployment:</ins>

 - Heroku, Github, git 
### Learning Objectives: 
This project is designed to test my ability to build complex servers and access
data through a database. To succeed at this project, I needed to demonstrate
that I could do the following:

- Install and use common middleware packages
- Receive requests through routes
- Run tests from the command line
- Access relevant information through route and query parameters
- Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist
- Build an API following RESTful design principles
- Create and customize aÂ `knexfile.js`Â file
- Create a connection to my database with Knex
- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
- Return joined and nested data with Knex
- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool
- Deploy my new backend server to a cloud service
- Connect a frontend repo with a different author to my project successfully

### The Database's Structure:
Take a look at my PostgreSQL schema's Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), minus
Knex migration tables.
