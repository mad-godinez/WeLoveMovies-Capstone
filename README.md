## About Me:
- My name is Mad, you can think of it as "Maude" or "Mod" in your head,
  whichever works!
- I'm currently enrolled in Thinkful's Fullstack Software Engineering course &
  having a really great time learning this material. I also earned my BA in
  Spanish Studies & Computer Science from Texas State University (*magna cum
  laude* woot woot!) in the winter of 2021, so I was fortunate to have a good
  foundation of programming knowledge going into this course. 
- This bootcamp is wrapping up at the beginning of May 2022, so please feel free
  to reach out if you've got me in mind for a junior developer role!
